## Hey, I'm Anya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a postgraduate student in the Cognitive Science MSc program at the University of Edinburgh. I have a passion for ethical, human-oriented solutions through technology, particularly in the healthcare and brain studies sectors. 

* With a Computer Science undergrad background, I have a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, specifically topics such as Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
* I find the brain fascinating and am taking Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, and Bioinformatics classes to learn more!
